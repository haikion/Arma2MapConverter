Arma2MapConverter
=================

Convert ArmA 2 2D Maps into SQF (3D Editor)

This programm reads in mission.sqm files and converts it into an .sqf file 
that can be called like every .sqf script and will place the converted units on the map.

Currently working:

	- Converting units, groups and vehicles (also empty vehicles).
	
Will be working soon:

	- Converting markers/triggers and waypoints.
